## West wed chess pieces

A model for chess pieces. The core is simple one squiggle for each piece types, each squiggle rather similar.
Just so happens these squiggles can be rotated around an axis to make 3D volumes.
Or if the same squiggles are mirrored across an axis then flat pieces can be laser-cut out of, say, plywood and inter meshed to have pieces that stand.
Or the squiggles could, without mirroring, be used to laser-cut a line on some plywood that could then be used for a wood lathe.
